# Data

We do NOT store large datasets in GitHub.

Put downloaded data here locally:
- raw/       = original, untouched dataset
- processed/ = cleaned/feature-engineered outputs

Where to get the dataset:
- (add link/instructions here once decided)

Rules:
- Do not commit large data files.
- Do not edit raw data in-place; write processed outputs to processed/.
